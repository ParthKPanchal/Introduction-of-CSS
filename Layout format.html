            <h1>Sophia a social humanoid robot</h1>
            <p>Sophia has been covered by media around the globe, and has participated 
                in many high-profile interviews. In October 2017, 
                Sophia was given Saudi Arabian citizenship, and 
                became the first robot to receive citizenship 
                of any country. In November 2017, Sophia was 
                named the United Nations Development Programme's 
                first Innovation Champion, and is the first 
                non-human to be given a United Nations title.</p>

            <h1>Features</h1>
            <p>A computer vision algorithm processes input from cameras within Sophia's eyes, giving Sophia visual information on its surroundings. It can follow faces, sustain eye contact, and recognize individuals. It can process speech and have conversations using a natural language subsystem. Around January 2018, Sophia was upgraded with functional legs and the ability to walk. CNBC has commented on Sophia's "lifelike" skin and its ability to emulate more than 60 facial expressions.
                Sophia is conceptually similar to the computer program ELIZA, which was one of the first attempts at simulating a human conversation. The software has been programmed to give pre-written responses to specific questions or phrases, like a chatbot. These responses are used to create the illusion that the robot is able to understand conversation, including stock answers to questions like "Is the door open or shut?" In 2017 Hanson Robotics announced plans to open Sophia to a cloud environment using a decentralized blockchain marketplace.                
                David Hanson has said that Sophia would ultimately be a good fit to serve in healthcare, customer service, therapy and education. In 2019, Sophia displayed the ability to create drawings, including portraits.</p>
